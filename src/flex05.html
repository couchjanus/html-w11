                    <h3>Frank Bragg reporting</h3>
                    <p>The country was brought to a standstill today when flying saucers – presumably from Mars,
                        although Venusians have also been suspected – appeared over the nation’s capital, intent on
                        destruction. Curiously, they only attacked Pennsylvania Avenue, and have not appeared elsewhere
                        in the country.

                        found and killed by a hunter in the north-eastern corner of the state.
                        <p>The hunter plans to tour the pelt in the fall.

                    <p>Years of rumours were confirmed yesterday when a nest of alligators were found in the sewers of
                        New York City, just south of Times Square. The largest, which locals have dubbed “Mugsy”,
                        measures over 21 feet long.
